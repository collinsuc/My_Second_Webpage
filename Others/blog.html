    <p>
        <h2 style="color: blue;">As part of my passion for movies, I placed the steps for the
             movie project in this Blog</h2><br>
<p>This project is born out of my love for movies and in particular online 
videos. I decide to conclude my ALX journey with sharing my love for 
movies with the whole world for free. It is intended to provide 
a means of entertainment to viewers for free without a single charge. I believe in freedom:</p><br>
THE FIRST VERSION OF THE PROJECT: My Portfolio Project
<p>AWS Account Setup: I will Create an AWS account on the AWS website.
I will Use AWS Services for Video Streaming: a. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
 Store my video files in Amazon S3. Here I will Create buckets to organize the content
  of my media. I will Enable static website hosting on the bucket where all the videos
   will be stored. b. I will use the Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network):</p>
   <p> 
   Then Iâ€™ll Set up CloudFront to deliver video content globally with low latency. 
   I will then Create a distribution for your S3 bucket. c. I will employ the use 
   of the AWS Elemental Media Convert or Elastic Transcoder: Use MediaConvert or 
   Elastic Transcoder to encode my videos into different formats suitable for 
   streaming. d. I will use the AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB (Optional 
   for User Management): Then Implement Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB
    to handle user authentication, access control, and user data storage. e. I will 
    also use the AWS Elemental MediaPackage (Optional for Live Streaming): If you 
    plan to offer live streaming, consider using MediaPackage for secure and reliable
     live video delivery.</p>
<p>I will move on to Create a Website/Application: Develop a website or application 
using a framework or programming language of my choice. I will Use AWS SDKs or APIs
 to interact with AWS services from the application.
I will also Integrate a Video Player: Here I will Integrate a video player in the 
website/application to stream the videos hosted on Amazon S3 via CloudFront URLs.
Security and Access Control: I will Implement security measures like AWS Identity 
and Access Management (IAM), signed URLs, and encryption to protect the media content.
Testing and Monitoring: I will Test the website thoroughly for video playback,
 user experience, and performance. I will Set up monitoring and logging to 
 track usage, errors, and performance metrics using AWS CloudWatch.
Time to Launch and Scale: Once everything is set up and tested, I will launch
 the video streaming website. I will Monitor usage and performance to scale resources if needed.</p>
